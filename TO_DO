create the home page

have the read entry form and a link to view read log or collection, maybe some basic stats (# issues,comics,reads)

read entry form
 - comic (need to auto drop down matching titles as they type)
 - issue number 
 - issue format (select - single issue, TPB, prestige, HC)
 - read date (prefilled with today - change to calendar select eventually)

processing read form

 - comic and issue number are required
 - if date entered is not valid just use today
 - auto create comic or issue if they dont already exist
 
NOTES:
 - worried about issue number being a string, won't order correctly (numerically ascending), want to change to integer but then we need a way to differentiate between various covers/printings/etc
