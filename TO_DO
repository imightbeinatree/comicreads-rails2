what else goes on the home page

maybe some basic stats (# issues,comics,reads)

read entry form issues
 - comic (need to auto drop down matching titles as they type)
 - issue format select needs to be put on the page - single issue, TPB, prestige, HC) - relies on way to manage formats
 - read date should be prefilled with today
 - Want to add tags so you can tag issues with anything (character, location, etc)
 - some sort of concept of own this issue vs just read it (owner flag)

format manager
- add/delete - can't delete format in use

navigation
- put under header, have reads | comics

comics home
- stars next to ones you own throughout interface when filtered to 'all'
- comics section has a nav at the top - all | mine - these goes to comics index, default filter is 'mine' (do this after owner flag implemented)
- show comics in alpha order, show number of issues after each title, linked to page for specific comic
- paginate alphabetically

comic issue home
- list issues of particular comic
- list times read

processing read form (check our validations)
 - comic and issue number are required
 - if date entered is not valid just use today

reading log viewing
 - better navigation in reading log, perhaps a "jump to a date" type of navigation to get back to any place
 - Need a way to view full entry for a read so you can view notes (think we need to make sure that read notes are different from the description field we plan to add to comic)
 - Delete an issue from collection (need to implement owner flag on read entry form)
 - Need other ways to view collection (by comic)
 - Need graphs for reading habits -> put them everywhere!! home page!
 
NOTES:
 - worried about issue number being a string, won't order correctly (numerically ascending), want to change to integer but then we need a way to differentiate between various covers/printings/etc
