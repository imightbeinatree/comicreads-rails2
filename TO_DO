what else goes on the home page

maybe some basic stats (# issues,comics,reads)

read entry form issues
 - comic (need to auto drop down matching titles as they type)
 - issue format select needs to be put on the page - single issue, TPB, prestige, HC)
 - read date should be prefilled with today
 - Want to add tags so you can tag issues with anything (character, location, etc)


processing read form (check our validations)
 - comic and issue number are required
 - if date entered is not valid just use today

reading log viewing
 - Need to paginate reads (jump to a date type navigation to get back to any place?)
 - Need a way to view full entry for a read so you can view notes (think we need to make sure that read notes are different from the description field we plan to add to comic)
 - Need a way to delete a read, delete an issue from collection
 - Need other ways to view collection (by comic)
 - Need graphs for reading habits
 
NOTES:
 - worried about issue number being a string, won't order correctly (numerically ascending), want to change to integer but then we need a way to differentiate between various covers/printings/etc
